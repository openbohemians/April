A new take on APL.

Spaces are required.

All objects are tensors.

Basic Math

    1 + 1 = 2
    2 × 3 = 6


Vector Math

    1 2 3 + 1 = 2 3 4 

    1 2 3 + 1 2 3 = 2 4 6


    1 2 3 @ 1 = 1

    1 2 3 4 ° 2 @ 2 1 = 3

    1 2 3 ] + = 6

    3 | * 2 . # 4 = 48


Boolean Logic

    O (+) 0 = 0
    0 (+) 1 = 1

    0 (×) 0 = 0
    0 (×) 1 = 0
